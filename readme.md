# ip_ledger: Decentralized Intellectual Property Management Platform

**ip_ledger** is a blockchain-based solution for securely and transparently managing intellectual property (IP) data. Built on Ethereum-compatible networks, it empowers users to register, update, and manage IP records without intermediaries, ensuring authenticity and trustless transactions.

## Features
- Register, update, and remove intellectual property records.
- Transparent and immutable record management using blockchain technology.
- Complete user ownership of intellectual property data with no central authority.
- Easy retrieval of IP details.
- Built with Solidity smart contracts and integrates seamlessly with Web3-enabled wallets.

## Contract Details
- **Contract Address**: `0x18D91D6d0451072aB772680825e15d6350192d86`
- **Network**: Ethereum Testnet (Mantle Sepolia)

## Deployment
- **Contract Address**: [View on Explorer](https://sepolia.mantlescan.xyz/address/0x18D91D6d0451072aB772680825e15d6350192d86)
- **Coin Used**: MNT (Mantle Sepolia Testnet MNT)

## How to Use
1. **Register Intellectual Property**: Users can register IPs with details like title, description, and owner information.
2. **Update IP Details**: Modify the metadata of an existing IP record securely.
3. **Remove IP Record**: Delete an IP record when it is no longer valid.
4. **View IP Records**: Retrieve a list of all intellectual property records associated with a user's account.

## Frontend
The frontend enables users to interact with the IP management smart contract via an intuitive interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages Web3.js for blockchain integration.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Deploy the smart contract on a test network.
3. Configure the frontend to interact with the deployed contract.
4. Connect using MetaMask to begin managing intellectual property securely.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IPFS for storing IP documentation and certificates.
- Advanced search and filter options for intellectual property records.
- Multi-signature wallet support for shared ownership of IPs.
- Support for royalty tracking and automated payments for licensed IP.
